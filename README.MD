## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters a **destination or keyword** (e.g., “beach”, “Tokyo”, “mountain”) in the search bar.  
2. The app searches through `travel.json` for matching destinations.  
3. Matching results are displayed dynamically in the `#results` section.  
4. The user can **reset** the results anytime using the Reset button.
